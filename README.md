# compile_commands.json gallery

This repository contains examples showing how `compile_commands.json` can be generated for various build
systems and their plugins.

The tool is used by me to test whether one of my Clang tools - [clang-uml](https://github.com/bkryza/clang-uml) -
works with compilation databases generated by these build systems.

Each subdirectory contains the same C++ hello world project with minimal configuration for a given build system
require to build it and generate `compile_commands.json`.

The list of examples currently contains:
* [b2](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/tools/build/doc/html/index.html) - [`b2`](./b2)
* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
  * [bazel-compile-commands-extractor](https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor) - [`bazel_bazel_compile_commands_extractor`](./bazel_bazel_compile_commands_extractor)
* [buck2](https://github.com/facebook/buck2) - [`buck2`](./buck2)
* [Clang++ with -MJ flag](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html#supported-systems) - [`clang_mj`](./clang_mj)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - [`cmake`](./cmake)
* [make]()
  * [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) - [`make_bear`](./make_bear)
  * [compiledb](https://github.com/nickdiego/compiledb) - [`make_compiledb`](./make_compiledb)
  * [compile_flags.txt](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html#alternatives) - [`make_compile_flags`](./make_compile_flags)
* [Meson Build](https://mesonbuild.com/) - [`mesonbuild`](./mesonbuild)
* [Premake](https://premake.github.io/)
  * [premake-ecc](https://github.com/MattBystrin/premake-ecc) - [`premake_ecc`](./premake_ecc)
  * [premake-export-compile-commands](https://github.com/tarruda/premake-export-compile-commands) - [`premake_premake_export_compile_commands`](./premake_premake_export_compile_commands)
* [SCons](https://scons.org/) - [`scons`](./scons)
* [xmake](https://xmake.io) - [`xmake`](./xmake)


# Generating compile commands
The project contains a top-level [Makefile](./Makefile), which can be used to generate compile commands for specific
build system and plugin combination, e.g.:

```console
$ make cmake
```

The target is just the name of the directory containing the specific project.

By default, after generating the `compile_commands.json`, each target will try to run `clang-tidy` and `clang-uml`
on that project to verify that these tools accept it. If you want to disable either of these tools just set the path to
the tool executable to the `true` command, e.g.:

```console
$ CLANG_UML_BIN=true make make_bear
```
