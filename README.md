# compile_commands.json gallery

This repository contains examples showing how `compile_commands.json` can be generated for various build
systems and their plugins.

The tool is used by me to test whether one of my Clang tools - [clang-uml](https://github.com/bkryza/clang-uml) -
works with compilation databases generated by these build systems.

Each subdirectory contains the same C++ hello world project with minimal configuration for a given build system
require to build it and generate `compile_commands.json`.

The list of examples currently contains:

# Generating compile commands
The project contains a top-level [Makefile](./Makefile), which can be used to generate compile commands for specific
build system and plugin combination.

## Linux

```console
$ ./make.lua cmake
```

The target is just the name of the directory containing the specific project.

## macos

On macos, you might want to use Homebrew Clang instead XCode, in that case run the test like this:

```console
./make.lua cmake
```
